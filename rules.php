		<h2>Rules</h2>
		<h3 id="ranking">How does the ranking system work?</h3>
		When you play a game you will gain points:
		<ul>
			<li>Winning: 3 points.</li>
			<li>Losing: 1 point.</li>
		</ul>
		This is intended to make it as easy to play games as possible as even if you lose you will gain points.
		<h3 id="how">How are ladder matches arranged?</h3>
		You should join the channel "UWCS" within StarCraft II and arrange matches with each other there.<br />
		Each player's SC2 character name and character code are also listed on their profile page so you can add them within the game if you are having trouble tracking them down.<br />
		If you are keen then there is also a channel called #starcraft on <a href="http://uwcs.co.uk/cms/about/services/irc/">our irc server</a>.
		<h3 id="maps">Which maps should we use?</h3>
		All games should be 1v1 melee on the faster setting.<br />
		The map pool is:
		<ul>
			<li>WCS Antiga Shipyard</li>
			<li>WCS Cloud Kingdom</li>
			<li>WCS Daybreak LE</li>
			<li>WCS Entombed Valley</li>
			<li>ESL Metropolis</li>
			<li>WCS Ohana LE</li>
			<li>WCS Shakuras Plateau</li>
		</ul>
		<h3 id="report">How do I report games?</h3>
		It is the winner's responsibility to report games, you can do this on the <a href="report.php">Report Result</a> page by selecting who you were playing against and attaching the replay file.  You must give a replay for every game you play.
